Inspired by popular developer hubs, such as crates.io (Rust), pypi.org (Python), and npmjs.com (JavaScript), Trunk aims to foster an information-rich environment. Here, developers can interact with the registry in a variety of ways and proudly showcase their contributions. Furthermore, users can gain insights into valuable metrics on extension downloads and trends.</p> <p>At its core, the goal of trunk is to cultivate a thriving Postgres extension ecosystem by lowering the barriers to building, sharing, and using Postgres extensions.</p>"},{"location":"#roadmap","title":"Roadmap","text":"<p>The Trunk infrastructure can be divided into the following: a command line interface (CLI), a registry, and a website.</p>"},{"location":"#the-cli","title":"The CLI","text":"<p>The CLI toolkit will abstract away many complexities in extension development and installation by using the following commands:</p> <p><code>trunk init</code> - setup your environment to build a new Postrgres extension.</p> <p><code>trunk test</code> - facilitate the automated unit and integration testing Postgres extensions.</p> <p><code>trunk build</code> - compiles extensions. - supports nested dependencies, e.g. installing <code>extension_a</code> will automatically install <code>extension_b</code> if required.</p> <p><code>trunk publish</code> - publishes an extension to the registry, making it available for discovery and installation.</p> <p><code>trunk install</code> - download and install the extension distribution, in whichever environment trunk is run.</p>"},{"location":"#the-registry","title":"The Registry","text":"<p>To complement the CLI, we are building a public registry for distributing extension source code and compiled binaries matched to operating system, architecture, Postgres version, and extension version.</p> <p>This purpose-built registry would provide a centralized location for developers to share extensions and for users to discover them.</p>"},{"location":"#the-website","title":"The Website","text":"<p>We will launch a website to help developers both discover and learn about extensions.
